    <h2>How to prepare</h2>
    <li>Heat a splash of oil in a large pan. Then add 1 diced large onion and cook for a few minutes and add 750g of minced beef.</li>
    <li> Add 2 Knorr chicken stock cubes, salt to taste, pepper to taste, a pinch of thyme, stir and cook for 3-5 minutes.</li>  
    <li>Then, add 3-4 precooked, diced potatoes, 4-5 diced carrots and 1-2 cups of flour mix and stir. Leave to cook for 5-7 minutes or until done. Set aside and leave to cool.s</li>  
    <li> Combine flour mix and butter together by rubbing both together using your fingertips. Alternatively, you can add the flour mix and butter to a food processor and pulse until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs.</li>
    <li>Pour in 375-450ml /2-3 cups of cold water and mix everything together until it forms a ball.</li>    
    <li>Preheat oven at 170Â°C/340F. Then, divide the dough into two to make it easier when rolling. Use a rolling pin to flatten the first dough.
    </li>
    <li> The pastry should be about 5mm thick. Use something circular to cut out the pastry for each pie. Repeat these steps with the remaining dough.</li>
    <li>Add the minced beef filling to half of the pastry. Make sure the filling is not close to the edges as you will need enough space to seal the pie. Brush egg wash around the edges of the pastry then fold the pie over. Use a fork to seal the edges.</li>
    <li>Finally, grease an oven tray with margarine or butter then add the meat pies to the tray. Lightly brush each pie with egg wash. Bake pies in preheated oven for 30-40 minutes.</li>
