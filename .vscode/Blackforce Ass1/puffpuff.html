    <h2>List of Ingredients</h2>
    <li>Flour</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Yeast</li>
    <li>Cooking Oil</li>

    <h2>How to prepare</h2>
    <li>Mix salt, sugar, water, and yeast . Set aside for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add flour and mix.</li>  
    <li>Let the mixture rise for approximately 1- 2 hours</li>  
    <li>In a large,sauce pan pour vegetable oil into a pot, until it is at least 3 inches (or about 5 centimeters) high (too little will result in flatter balls), and place on low heat.</li>
    <li>Test to make sure the oil is hot enough by putting a ‘drop’ of batter into the oil. If it is not hot enough, the batter will stay at the bottom of the pot rather than rising to the top.</li>    
    <li>Using your hands grab a little bit of mixture at time and drop in the oil.</li>
    <li> When the oil is hot enough, use a spoon to dish up the batter, and another spoon or spatula to drop it in the oil, sort of in the shape of a ball.</li>
    <li>Fry for a few minutes until the bottom side is golden brown.</li>
    <li>Turn the ball over and fry for a few more minutes until the other side is golden brown.</li>
